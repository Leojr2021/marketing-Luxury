      <h1>Why you should hire us?</h1>
      <p>
        One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their
        ability to market your property to the right target audience. A
        professional agent with the right experience will be able to identify
        who will be interested in your property and implement effective
        strategies to reach them via their website, paid advertising, social
        media, and other means. When you work with an agent who has partnered
        with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different types of
        marketing capabilities the company offers.

        <h2>Paid Advertising on All Channels</h2>
        <p>
          To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where
          they spend their time online, and how they make their buying
          decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are
          able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook,
          Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in your
          property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted,
          ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who are not in
          the market for a property such as yours.

      <div class="information__text information__text-left">
        <h2>Expert Content Production</h2>
        <p>
          Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has
          to promote your property. Being able to create high-quality content
          such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the
          agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their
          competitors. According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and
          sellers want to work with an agent who uses video—and for good reason.
          An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a
          deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to
          market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be
          like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more
          difficult to do with a written description. However, written
          descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to
          be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any
          additional marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work
          with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters
          who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make
          your property attractive to potential buyers. .

        <h2>Effective Search Engine Optimization</h2>
        <p>
          Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they
          purchased on the internet. Many of them simply googled the search
          terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that
          way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real
          estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing.
          The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine
          optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using
          the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at
          Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms
          that match your home, your property will show up in the results and
          provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

      <div class="information__text information__text-left">
        <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
        <p>
          If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she
          has access to thousands of niche buyers who are ready to invest in
          property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a
          large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with
          luxury real estate marketing service providers who can put in the work
          for them. Wouldn't you rather your agent spent his or her time
          marketing your property and let an expert handle their social media
          presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an
          agent's stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an
          authority in their industry. Once they've harnessed the power of
          becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your
          home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.
